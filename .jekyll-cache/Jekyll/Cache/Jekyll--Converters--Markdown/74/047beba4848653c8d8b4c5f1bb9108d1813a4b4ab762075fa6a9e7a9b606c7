I"E<p>Hi, My name is Madhavrao Pachupate.</p>

<p>I am a technologist and a problem solver.</p>

<p>I have been working in the I.T. industry for more than 18 years, and have extensive experience of working in diverse technologies - mainly on Microsoft technologies right from VB 6.0 to.Net Core covering - with ASP.Net, WCF, WF, WPF, Silverlight, MOSS, CRM, Commer Server 2002, Biztalk in between. I also have extensive work experience in JavaScript world - right from YUI, jQuery, KnockoutJS, DurandalJS, AngularJS, ReactJS, ViewJS to NodeJS (ExpressJS, HapiJS, RestifyJS). Apart from this I have worked on Sigle SignOn Solutions like ADFS, Tivoli, PingFederate, ForgeRock products - OpenAM, OpenDJ, OpenIDM, OpenIG, API Gateways - WS02, Apigee, Layer7, AWS-API Gateway, NoSQL Databases - Redis, Neo4J, Cassandra, DynamoDB, Web Crawler - like Nutch, StormCrawler, RDBMS - SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, Mobile Application development using Object-C, Ionic Framework. Overall I am not shy or rather too eager to try my hands on unknown technologies and explore more.</p>

<p>I have worked in diverse domains like - Retail, Travel Domain (Hotels, Airlines, Travel CRM), Pharma (Inventory, Manufacturing, and Supply Chain Management), Insurance (Claim Management). I am more of the technology guy than a domain guy and would rely on domain expert to cover myself for lack of domain expertise. Having worked in diverse domains - has enriched my experience in technology as each of the domain have different requirements - in user experience, non-functional and security requirements.</p>

<p>I wish to contribute - by enabling individuals, teams, and organization to make better decisions on technology and how to implement them for maximum impact.</p>

<p>Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to email me at madhavraop-at-outlook.com</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
