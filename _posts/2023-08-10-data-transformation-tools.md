Data transformation/modeling tools are software solutions that convert raw data into meaningful and usable formats, structures, or models. This process involves cleaning, structuring, enriching, and transforming data so it's suitable for analytics, reporting, or other specific business uses. Data modeling, however, often refers to defining and analyzing data requirements and creating conceptual, logical, and physical data models.

Examples of Data Transformation/Modeling Tools:

1. **[dbt](/data-platform/2023/08/12/dbt/) (data build tool)**: A command-line tool that enables data analysts and engineers to transform and model data in the data warehouse. It leverages SQL and offers version control, testing, and documentation capabilities.
2. **Looker's LookML**: A modeling layer within Looker, a BI tool that allows for data transformation and modeling in a more semantic way, defining relationships between tables and creating reusable SQL snippets.
3. **Dataform**: A tool that offers SQL-based data modeling and allows data teams to create document, test, and version control datasets.
4. **Talend**: A comprehensive data integration tool offering data transformation and modeling functionalities.
5. **Trifacta**: A data wrangling tool focused on transforming and cleaning data using a more user-friendly interface, reducing the need for complex coding.
6. **Alteryx**: A data blending, cleansing, and modeling platform that provides a drag-and-drop interface.
7. **Informatica PowerCenter**: A widely used ETL tool that provides data integration solutions for data warehousing, migration, etc., and includes data transformation capabilities.
8. **Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**: A platform that provides ETL, data integration, and transformation solutions using many out-of-the-box tools.
9. **Erwin Data Modeler**: A tool dedicated to data modeling, allowing for creating of physical, logical, and conceptual data models.
10. **IBM InfoSphere DataStage**: Part of the IBM InfoSphere suite, DataStage is an ETL tool with powerful data transformation capabilities.
11. **SAS Data Management**: A software suite that offers various tools for data integration, quality, governance, and preparation.
12. **Tableau Prep**: An extension of the Tableau ecosystem, Tableau Prep allows users to clean and shape their data before analysis in Tableau.
13. **Holistics**: A platform for data modeling and self-service BI, allowing users to model their data using SQL.
14. **Transform by Census**: An operational analytics tool that offers data modeling functionalities similar to dbt.

When choosing a data transformation/modeling tool, it's essential to consider factors such as data sources, volume, and destination, the technical proficiency of the users, the scale of data operations, and the specific business requirements you aim to address.
